# lantern_movie_recommender

This isn't an original project, it's completely adapted from https://lantern.dev/tutorials/python/movies.

The intention is for you to initially run `setup.sh` on your unix system to set up the basic dependencies.

Then, you populate the database and create the lantern index using `setup_embeddings.py` and should be able to call
`main.py` with a movie index to fetch similar movies for.
